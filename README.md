# Asana DSM Generator

Chrome extension to generate DSM for tasks scheduled for today and tomorrow.

## Description

My motivation for this project stems from the daily task of updating the DSM at the end of the day, listing the tasks completed today and those scheduled for tomorrow. The manual process of copying each task individually and posting it in the Slack channel of the corresponding project is quite cumbersome.

Directly copy and paste DSM in your preferred text editor or software application

Open any asana project in the browser and click on **Copy DSM**, script will take url from browser url and fetch relavant data of this project. To fetch other project details, just change project in asana and click **Copy DSM** that's it, DSM will be copied.
